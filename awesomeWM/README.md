These files are for awesomeWM!
rc.lua is the main config file.
theme.lua handles background stuff (e.g. background = ~/Downloads/mudkip.png).

autorun.sh is a script from the Arch wiki which auto-starts compton on awesomeWM launch.
autorun.sh uses compton.conf, provided in the same repo.
It goes at the end of the script there and compton auto-starts :)
